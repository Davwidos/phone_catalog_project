          iPhone 11 Pro lets you capture videos that are beautifully true to
          life, with greater detail and smoother motion. Epic processing power
          means it can shoot 4K video with extended dynamic range and cinematic
          video stabilization — all at 60 fps. You get more creative control,
          too, with four times more scene and powerful new editing tools to play
          with.
